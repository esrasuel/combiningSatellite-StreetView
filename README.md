This repository holds the code used to implement the proposed methods and produce the experimental results in our article. Unfortunately, we cannot share the data nor the trained models at this moment due to regulatory constraints. Instead, we aim to describe the curated data and provide command line arguments for training and testing the models. 

### Dataset
The dataset consists of street-level images and satellite images from the same geographical location, longitude and lattitude of the street level images, and labels associated with both street-level and satellite images. 

The lattitude and longitude of street level images are necessary to
